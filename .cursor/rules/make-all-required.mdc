# Code change completion

Before reporting that a code change is complete, you **must** run:

```bash
make all
```

and it must succeed. Do not tell the user the change is done until `make all` has passed.

`make all` runs format check, lint, coverage, and build. If it fails, fix the issues (or inform the user what failed and what they need to do), then run `make all` again until it succeeds.
